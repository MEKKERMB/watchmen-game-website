                            Watchmen: The End is Nigh is a video game that serves as a prequel to the film adaptation of
                            the DC Comics limited series Watchmen by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. The game takes place
                            in the 1970s, where players control the Comedian and Nite Owl as they uncover a plot by a
                            villain who is trying to discredit all past and present superheroes.
